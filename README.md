## First Segment Goal

Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

## First Segment Role

Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

## Preprocessing Sample Data

Sample data selected: Texas 2020

Initial data processing completed to identify relevant information to explore:

Read in csv files of interest, remove extra columns in each df that are not necessary for data analysis, remove records that have NaN values from each df, merge df’s to flatten the hierarchal data structure to allow for initial data exploration
